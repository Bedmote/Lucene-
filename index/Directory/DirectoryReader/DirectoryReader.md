/** DirectoryReader is an implementation of {@link CompositeReader}
 that can read indexes in a {@link Directory}. 

 <p>DirectoryReader instances are usually constructed with a call to
 one of the static <code>open()</code> methods, e.g. {@link
 #open(Directory)}.

 <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
 <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
 document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral -- they may change
 as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
 rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.

 <p>
 <a name="thread-safety"></a><p><b>NOTE</b>: {@link
 IndexReader} instances are completely thread
 safe, meaning multiple threads can call any of its methods,
 concurrently.  If your application requires external
 synchronization, you should <b>not</b> synchronize on the
 <code>IndexReader</code> instance; use your own
 (non-Lucene) objects instead.
